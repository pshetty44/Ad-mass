### 1 Motivation:
AdMass is an influencer marketing platform that helps advertisers find their advocates on social media. Their technology allows advertisers to manage their relationship with advocates, facilitate advertising campaigns (influencers creating content and distributing it on their social media platforms), and report on the effectiveness of these campaigns.

Understanding social media engagement (likes, comments, shares) and its relationship to content is increasingly important both to advertisers and individuals. Advertisers use these metrics to make hiring decisions when partnering with social media influencers. Influencers (those on social media with a significant following) study engagement to learn what type of content to post more or less.


However, average engagement varies significantly between different content categories (fashion, travel, beauty, home improvement, fitness, etc.). The goal of this project is to create a classifier to automatically categorize an influencer based on their content. This will allow Admass to normalize performance metrics like engagement by the average engagement in that category. Further, it will help Admass improve searching for influencers, as they will be able to focus just on those influencers in the relevant categories for an advertiser.


### 2 Project Scope:
1. Influencers may fall into one or more categories (ex. fashion and beauty)
2. A "score" of how well the influencer fits into any category would be beneficial
3. This analysis should be limited to Instagram
4. In general, we are interested in influencers with at least 1,000 followers or more
5. "Content" can include and influencer's bio, text and photos in their posts, and their followers
   comments on those posts, or even the content of their followers or those that the influencer follows.
6. Which pieces of content are most indicative of category? (ex. bio, captions, user comments)
7. Can additional categories be automatically generated by studying those influencers who don't fit
   well into other categories?

### 4 The model:
Text analytics was done using NLP and I used K-means to get clusters.

</p>


#### 5 Output:
The model assigns a score to each cluster which determines how close a user is to that cluster.
